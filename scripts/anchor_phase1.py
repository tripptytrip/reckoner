"""Gate 14: anchor the Phase-1 checkpoint by digest, with full provenance.

An anchor is what every later pass is compared *against*, so it has to be
identifiable by something the comparison cannot silently change. The digest is
that something. Everything else here exists so a reader a month from now can
answer "what was this, exactly?" without trusting a filename:

* the checkpoint's sha256, appended to ``runs/ANCHORS.sha256``
* the config fingerprint, ruleset and vocab versions the checkpoint carries
* the **dataset digests it trained on**, verified against the datasets as they
  are on disk right now — an anchor whose training data has been rebuilt under
  it is not the anchor anyone thinks it is
* the gate records by digest, so the anchor points at the evidence rather than
  restating it

Refuses to write if the training data no longer matches what the run recorded.
That is the F-02 lesson at the anchor layer: a provenance field that cannot be
checked is a claim, and the trusted value is computed or absent.
