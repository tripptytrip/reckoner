"""M1's launcher. **The campaign, at the registered config, through its own door.**

There is exactly one behaviour here that is not `reckoner.campaign.run_campaign`:
choosing where the run directory lives. A path is not a behaviour — it names
where artifacts land, not what the loop does — and everything that *is* a
behaviour (extent, treatment size, thread pins, cadence) lives in
`CampaignConfig` under the fingerprint, which `run_campaign` asserts before it
spends anything.

So this script takes no `--iterations`, no `--episodes`, no `--sims`. If a number
here could change what M1 measures, it would be config that escaped the
fingerprint, which is the caller-choice hazard standing at the command line.

**The five-iteration dress rehearsal uses this same script.** It is not a
rehearsal mode — `campaign.iterations = 20` is under the fingerprint and setting
it to 5 moves the fingerprint to `7ba86c45…`, which this door refuses. The
rehearsal is the campaign's first five iterations, stopped externally once
`LATEST` reads 4, which the resume gate licenses: iteration 5's provisional
artifacts are exactly the debris `test_campaign_resume.py` kills into and
resumes from at both boundaries.
