"""Part 0e: the uniform-stub null on the successor strata {7, 8, 10}.

The four-tuple's last empty cell. Part-0d measured what the **anchor** does on the
scripted strata and certified three of them live; P1 will be stated as a
CI-separated improvement in pooled beat-par rate over that baseline. A baseline
without a null is a number with nothing underneath it: 101/600 = 0.1683 means one
thing if a policy-free search beats par at 0.02, and something very different if
it beats par at 0.15.

**Rider (c) does not exempt successors.** The null row is owed here exactly as it
was owed on the original axis, and nobody had computed it.

**The protocol is Part-0d's, inherited rather than restated** — sims 48, m 16,
root noise off, seed 0, the eval profile, value-silent — because the baseline's
protocol is the primary's protocol, and a null measured under a different one is
not a null for this baseline. The single deliberate difference is the evaluator:
:func:`reckoner.search.uniform_stub` in place of the model, which is what makes
this a null rather than a second measurement of the anchor.

`scripted_in_9` is excluded: Part-0d found it the sole stratum born saturated
from above (beat-par 164/200 = 0.82) and demoted it to informational.
