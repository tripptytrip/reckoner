"""Gate predicates, defined once and imported by every consumer.

**A gate expressed in a test and separately in a script is two gates wearing one
name.** Proof, and the reason this module exists: F-13 changed the terminal value
scale, the depth-1 predicate was re-expressed in `tests/test_search.py`, and
`scripts/chunk7_gate_table.py` kept the old expression — so the first re-run
reported **0/200 at every m** for a search that was working correctly. One edit
had to be two, and only one was made.

Same family as the one-formatter law (a caption describes or it calls
`render_expr()`; there is no third path) and the one-legality-oracle rule. A
predicate that decides whether a gate passed is exactly the kind of thing that
must have one implementation, because the two copies fail apart silently and the
failure looks like a result.

Predicates here are **scale-independent by construction** wherever they can be:
they read what the search *did*, not what a value happened to equal. That is what
survived F-13 — the chunk-7 gates were never scale-dependent in what they meant,
only in how one of them was written.
