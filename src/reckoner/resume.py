"""Crash-resume: one atomic commit point, and everything else is provisional.

The write-ordering contract
---------------------------
**The iteration is the atomic unit, and `LATEST` is the only thing that makes one
real.** Per iteration *n*, in this order:

1. ``ring-<n>/``      — the replay ring, written to a *fresh* directory (never
                        overwriting a committed one), its own ``meta.json`` last
2. ``state-<n>.json`` — iteration counter, value-head declaration, seed
3. one row appended to ``iterations.jsonl``
4. ``LATEST``         — written via temp-file + ``os.replace``, which is atomic

Steps 1–3 are **provisional**: a process killed anywhere in them leaves artifacts
for an iteration that never happened, and resume ignores or removes them. Only
step 4 commits, and it is a single-file rename, which the filesystem gives us
atomically. There is no window in which `LATEST` names a half-written iteration.

Why not "the row is the commit point"
--------------------------------------
Because the ring is written before the row and would then contain the killed
iteration's steps. Resuming would redo the iteration and append those steps
again, so the ring would carry each of them twice — silently, and only in runs
that crashed. A duplicated replay corpus is the kind of defect that shows up as a
mildly odd loss curve six iterations later.

The two kill points this is tested through
-------------------------------------------
* **A — after the ring and state, before the row.** Resume finds no committed
  row and redoes *n*; the orphaned ``ring-<n>``/``state-<n>`` are ignored.
* **B — after the row, before ``LATEST``.** Resume finds a row for an
  uncommitted iteration and **truncates it**, then redoes *n*.

Both must land on state identical to an uninterrupted run — asserted, not
asserted-about.
