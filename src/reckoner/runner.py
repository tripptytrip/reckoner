"""The Phase-2 episode runner: many episodes in lockstep, one pooled evaluator.

Batching is **across concurrent episode searches, never within one tree.** The
plan's "batched leaves" wording predates F-06 and is superseded: inside a tree,
simulation *k+1*'s selection depends on *k*'s backup, so pooling there changes
what the tree does. Across episodes there is no coupling, so parity with
sequential play stays an equality rather than a tolerance — and it is the shape
AGENTS.md §8 prescribes anyway. `search.batch_searches` is the key and the law.

Every live episode takes one search per round; their leaf requests are pooled by
:func:`reckoner.search.run_batched`; each applies its chosen action and the round
repeats until no episode is live.

The descent gate rides in
-------------------------
Chunk 7 measured `evaluations == nodes` at every budget and the forward
obligation was to assert it here. **The equality does not generalise, and the
exception has a name rather than a relaxation:** a *terminal* leaf creates a node
without an evaluation. The invariant that does hold universally, verified against
the search before being asserted, is

    nodes - evaluations
        == terminal_solved + terminal_no_actions + state_too_large + step_cap_reached

Chunk 7's `evals == nodes` is exactly its zero-terminal special case, which is why
the descent gate saw it: a branchy depth-5 SOLVE at 48 sims reaches no terminal.
Real episodes reach terminals constantly — that is the point of them — so
asserting the equality here would have failed on correct behaviour, and widening
it to an inequality would have asserted nothing. The identity is the honest form.

The entropy split
-----------------
`logschema` has four waiting columns: prior and target entropy, each on start
states and on reached states. Prior entropy alone cannot distinguish a confident
policy from a collapsed one — that is the chess lesson — so the search-improved
target is logged beside it. "Start" is an episode's first search; "reached" is
every search after at least one rewrite. That mapping is the faithful analog of
chess's start-vs-book split and is an interpretation, not a transplant: there is
no openings book here.
