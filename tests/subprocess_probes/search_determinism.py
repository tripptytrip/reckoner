"""Cross-process determinism probe. Run as a FILE, never as an embedded string.

This lived as a quoted `-c` program inside two callers until a blind
`str.replace` matched *inside the literal* and broke both — twice in one session.
Documentation warns, methods help, **helpers prevent**: a program in its own file
has nothing for a text edit to corrupt silently, and it lints, imports and reads
like the code it is.

Prints one JSON line: the visit vector, the chosen action, sims used, and nodes.
The caller varies PYTHONHASHSEED and asserts every line is identical.
